# puppetlabs/http-client

This is a wrapper around the [http-kit](http://http-kit.org/) client
providing some extra functionality for configuring SSL in a way
compatible with Puppet.

Async versions of the http methods are exposed in
puppetlabs.http.client.async, and synchronous versions are in
puppetlabs.http.client.sync.
